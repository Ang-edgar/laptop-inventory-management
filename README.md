# Laptop Inventory Management System v1.2b (Beta)

A web-based tool for managing laptop inventory, spare parts, sales, warranty tracking, and now customer order management. Uses Flask and Docker, stores everything in a database so it works reliably across different computers.

## ðŸš€ New in v1.2b (Beta)

- **Guest & Admin Modes:**  
  - Customers (guests) can browse your storeâ€™s current stock without logging in.
  - Admins log in to manage inventory, orders, sales, and more.

- **Order System:**  
  - Guests can add multiple laptops to a cart and place an order.
  - Admins can view, confirm, reject, and process orders.
  - Orders move through statuses: unconfirmed, confirmed, in progress, completed.
  - Admins can revert completed sales back to orders if needed.

- **Order Tracking:**  
  - Guests can check their order status by email.

- **(Coming Soon)**  
  - Customers will be able to "build" a laptop with available spare parts.

## What It Does

### Smart Serial Numbers
Instead of just using 1, 2, 3... this generates proper serial numbers like **DE092501** (Dell laptop, added in September 2025, #1 for that month). Works for all major brands and automatically detects them from the laptop name.

### Warranty Tracking (NEW in v1.1)
Track warranties for sold laptops with smart countdown timers. Shows **196 days left** in green, **45 days left** in orange, and **15 days left** in red. Separate page for managing all ongoing warranties so you know when to follow up with customers.

### Track Everything
- Laptop specs (CPU, RAM, storage, operating system)
- Purchase price, selling price, fees, and automatic profit calculation
- Multiple photos per laptop stored in the database
- When you bought it, when you sold it, profit margins
- Warranty periods with automatic countdown and color alerts
- **Order management and tracking for customers and admins** ðŸš€
- Search through everything quickly

### Handle Spare Parts
Keep track of RAM sticks and storage drives separately, then link them to laptops when you install upgrades. Shows which laptops have extra components installed.

### Bulk Operations
Select multiple laptops and delete or duplicate them all at once. The duplicate feature creates copies with new serial numbers and adds "(Copy)" to the name.

### Sales & Warranty Management
- Mark laptops as sold and they move to a separate "completed sales" section.
- Add warranties to sold laptops and track them with color-coded timers.
- See which warranties are expiring soon.
- **Revert completed sales back to orders if needed.**

### Order Management (NEW)
- Guests can add multiple laptops to a cart and place an order.
- Admins can view, confirm, reject, and process orders.
- Orders are split into unconfirmed and confirmed sections for easy management.
- Guests can check their order status by email.

## Why I Built This

I buy, repair, and sell laptops as a side business. Existing solutions were either too complicated, too expensive, or didn't handle images properly. I wanted something that:

- Stores images in the database (not as files that can get lost)
- Generates professional-looking serial numbers
- Works the same whether I'm on my desktop or laptop
- Handles spare parts and upgrades
- Actually calculates profits correctly
- Tracks customer warranties so I know when they expire

## How It Works

### Database Design
Everything is stored in SQLite with proper relationships. Images are stored as binary data in the database, so they can't get lost when you move the database file around.

### User Interface
Clean design with a blue sidebar for navigation. Uses real buttons and forms, not fancy JavaScript frameworks that break. Responsive so it works on tablets too.

### Serial Numbers
The system looks at the laptop name (like "Dell Latitude 5400") and figures out it's a Dell, then generates DE092501 for the first Dell added in September 2025. Much better than random IDs.

### Warranty System
When you sell a laptop, you can add a warranty period. The system calculates days remaining and shows them with color coding - green for plenty of time, orange when getting close, red when almost expired.

## Installation

### With Docker (Recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ang-edgar/laptop-inventory-management.git
cd laptop-inventory-management
docker-compose up -d
```
Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

### Without Docker
```bash
pip install flask werkzeug
python app/app.py
```

## Features I'm Proud Of

- **Image management**: Upload multiple photos, set one as primary, delete individually
- **Bulk operations**: Select multiple laptops and handle them all at once  
- **Smart serial numbers**: Professional inventory codes with date and brand info
- **Spare parts tracking**: Know exactly what components you have and where they're installed
- **Profit calculations**: See exactly how much money you're making
- **Warranty tracking**: Color-coded countdown timers for customer warranties
- **Order management**: Guests can order laptops, admins can manage orders
- **No dependencies**: Runs entirely from the database file, easy to backup
